# My Invest
The main purpose of this project is to show different investment types in the same application or your investments in different applications in one application.

In the project, investment data such as stock market, foreign exchange, bitcoin, precious metals were obtained using APIs. The data was stored in CoreData for cases where we do not have an internet connection (The project works with CoreData, but the commands that work with SQLite are also included in the project file, only SQLite installation is required).
